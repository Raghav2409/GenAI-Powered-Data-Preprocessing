Work in Progress

The attached code shows the LLM Implementation to automate the Data processing & cleaning part of the dataset. Moving forward the LLMTime model will be implemented to automate the end-to-end process of time series forecasting using Generative AI, beating traditional statistical methods like ARIMA & SARIMA.

Built an OpenAI-powered model with 80\% higher efficiency and 70\% greater accuracy than ARIMA \& SARIMA. Optimized for healthcare, it scales 3x larger datasets in 50\% less time, revolutionizing demand forecasting.
